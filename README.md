# JOE
Java Object Environment

Java Object Environment will make software systems that are smaller, faster, configurable, scalable, 
self optimizing, and dynamic. It consists of a metacircular Java virtual machine, hardware platform objects, 
and software mobilization tool called JAM (Java on any machine). The combination of a 
metacircular VM and hardware platform objects replace the operating system and file system for an optimized 
platform for Java software applications to run in. JOE will produce a smaller software package (26MB) that is 
smaller, faster, optimized, dynamic, and secure.
