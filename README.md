# JOE
Java Object Environment

Java Object Environment will make software systems that are smaller, faster, configurable, scalable, self optimizing, and dynamic. It is a software virtualization tool that virtualizes the processor and hardware components into objects so that they can run on any machine, real or virtual. It consists of a metacircular Java virtual machine, hardware platform objects, and software virtualization tool called JAM (Java on any machine). The combination of a metacircular VM and hardware platform objects create a virtualized software application that replaces the operating system and file system, and creates an optimized platform for Java software applications to run in. JOE will produce a smaller software package (26MB) that is smaller, faster, optimized, dynamic, and secure.
