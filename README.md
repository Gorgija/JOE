# JOE
Java Object Environment

Java Object Environment will make software systems that are smaller, faster, configurable, scalable, self optimizing, and dynamic. It is a software tool using JikesRVM that can create processor and hardware objects so that they can run on any machine, real or virtual. It consists of JikesRVM, hardware platform objects, and software tool called JAM (Java on any machine). The combination of the metacircular JikesRVM and hardware platform objects creates a statically bound software application that replaces the operating system and file system, and creates an optimized platform for Java software applications to run in. JOE will produce a smaller software package (19MB) that is smaller, faster, optimized, dynamic, and secure.
